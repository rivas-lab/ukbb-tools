This directory will contain documentation on additional phenotype definitions (sessions) that were processed in an ad-hoc fashion because of the nature of the data and/or the way they were packaged by UK Biobank. This includes:

- Medication information
- Cancer diagnoses
- Probably some more that I (Matt) have forgotten about right now.

Each one of the above has its own notebook/script/folder in this directory, which contains documentation as to how that set of traits were processed and defined.
