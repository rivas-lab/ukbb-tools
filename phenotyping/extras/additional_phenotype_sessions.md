This will be documentation on additional phenotype definitions (sessions) that we been processed in an ad-hoc way, because of the nature of the data. This includes:
	- Medication information
	- Cancer diagnoses
	- Probably some more that I (Matt) have forgotten about right now.

Each one of the above has its own notebook/script/folder in this directory, which contains documentation as to how that set of traits were processed and defined.
