# LDSC wrapper functions

The input file needs to be in the LDSC format. For that, we have a conversion script called [`ukb_ldsc_munge_wrapper.sh`](ukb_ldsc_munge_wrapper.sh).

Once input files are converted, then you can call [`ukb_ldsc_rg_helper.sh`](ukb_ldsc_rg_helper.sh) for the analysis.

Note: both script calls Python script.
