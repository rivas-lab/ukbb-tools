UK Biobank Assessment Centre > Physical measures > Arterial stiffness,100007,4205,Pulse wave pressure versus time response curve,201468,222276,Complete,Compound,"",Data,Primary,Unisex,3,1,,"Wave data containing 3 waveforms, each consisting of one direct and one reflected component. A digital volume pulse can be considered to be the summation of a direct and a reflected component. The direct component is due to transmission of a pressure wave from the left ventricle to the finger via the most direct route. The reflected component is formed by pressure transmitted from the heart to the lower body where it is reflected back up the aorta and thence to the finger. Each waveform is actually a single pulse with 100 points. Since the heart rate is in beats per minute, a single beat takes 60seconds / Heart Rate and time between two beats is (60/Heart Rate)/100. The data is formatted as follows:  The first number (i.e. digits before the first '|' character)indicate the number of points X,Y for the curve.  Each pair of X,Y values is separated by a '|' character from the preceding/succeeding pair.  Each pair of X,Y values is separated internally by a ',' character. The X-axis is the time in milliseconds and the Y-axis is the Pulse signal strength in arbitrary units.",http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=4205

Past cigarette (either manufactured or hand rolled) smokers who smoked most days (smoking data fields used: ~F2867~, ~F2897~ and ~F2887~). Current cigar/pipe smokers who smoked most days and previously smoked cigarettes (smoking data fields used: ~F3436~, ~F6194~ and ~F6183~). The general definition of a pack year is the number of cigarettes smoked per day, divided by twenty, multiplied by the number of years of smoking. The number of years of smoking is calculated by substracting the age of starting smoking from the age smoking was stopped.   Number of cigarettes per day / 20 * (Age stopped smoking - Age start smoking)  The figure is adjusted for individuals who gave up smoking for more than 6 months, according to data fields 2907 or 3486 by subtracting six months from the number of years of smoking.  Number of cigarettes per day / 20 * (Age stopped smoking - Age start smoking - 0.5)  Note: Individuals who started and gave up smoking before 16 years of age were coded as NA. For individuals who started smoking before 16 but gave up after 16, their age start was set as 16. Individuals who reported starting and stopping smoking at the same age and reported giving up smoking for more than 6 months had pack-years set at 0.

The model of multiple deprivation which underpins the Indices of Deprivation 2010 is based on the idea of distinct domains of deprivation which can be recognised and measured separately. These domains are experienced by individuals living in an area. People may be counted in one or more of the domains, depending on the number of types of deprivation that they experience.  Each domain represents a specific form of deprivation experienced by people and each can be measured individually using a number of indicators. Seven distinct domains have been identified in the English Indices of Deprivation; Income Deprivation, Employment Deprivation, Health Deprivation and Disability, Education Skills and Training Deprivation, Barriers to Housing and Services, Living Environment Deprivation, and Crime. Individual domains can be used in isolation as measures of each specific form of deprivation. They can also be combined, using appropriate weights, into a single overall Index of Multiple Deprivation which can be used to rank every small area in England according to the deprivation experienced by the people living there. Along with two supplementary indices, Income Deprivation Affecting Children Index and Income Deprivation Affecting Older People Index, they form the English Indices of Deprivation. These statistics allow the most, and least, deprived areas of the country to be identified as well as providing information about the issues faced by people living in different parts of the country.",http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=26410

It was developed for the Welsh Assembly Government by the Assembly's Statistical Directorate and the Local Government Data Unit (Wales).   The WIMD 2008 is made up of eight separate domains (or kinds) of deprivation: income, employment, health, education, housing, environment, access to services, and community safety.   Each of them was based on a range of different indicators which meant that they were measured in different ways using different units. So before they could be combined the measurements had to be transformed to make them compatible. For example, if the height of something had been measured in metres and the weight in kilograms it would not make sense simply to add them together.   Income and employment were classed as the most important factors, and they were given the biggest weighting in the overall index.

The SIMD combines data from seven distinct domains or topic areas all of which are considered to be important contributors to deprivation levels. These domains have remained the same as in the previous version of the index, published in 2006, and the data used in compiling each one is the most appropriate and up to date that was available at the time of constructing the index.   The SIMD is a relative measure of deprivation that uses 6,505 data zones across Scotland as its unit of comparison. The rank applied to each of these data zones identifies each as being more or less deprived than all the others in the country. The rankings run from 1 being the most deprived to 6505 being the least deprived. Therefore the smaller the ranking the more deprived the data zone. As the SIMD is a relative measure it cannot show how much more deprived one data zone is than another, e.g. that a data zone ranked 5 is twice as deprived as a data zone ranked 10. In the same way the distance between each ranking can vary - so the gap between the data zones ranked 16 and 17 could be very small while the gap between those ranked 17 and 18 could be much bigger.   The SIMD can be used to identify the small areas with the highest concentrations of multiple deprivation in Scotland using either the overall index or the individual domains. The most commonly used cut off levels are 10%, 15% or 20% - although different cut offs may be required depending on individual policy or organisational focus.",http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/field.cgi?id=26427

A serving is about the amount that would be dished up using a serving spoon (large spoon typically used in canteens or self-service buffets). Example: a beef stew with carrot and parsnip may have enough vegetables in it to count as a half serving of carrots plus a half serving of parsnip (possibly even a whole serving if there are a lot of vegetables in the stew). If not, it may be better to record the vegetables as a half serving of Vegetable pieces.
