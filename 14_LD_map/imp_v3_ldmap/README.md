# LD map for the imputation dataset (v3)

We initially tried to characterize the LD map for all the variants in the imputed data, but we instead focused on the common variants.

## some scripts in this directory

### `imp_v3_ldmap.sbatch.sh`
This is a job script to compute LD map for imputation dataset

### `imp_v3_ldmap.check.sh`
This is a check script to see if we have the results
